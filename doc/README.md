General description
===================

Placeholder directory for generated documentation. 

Generating documentation
========================

Two build targets are provided: `doc` and `devdoc`, corresponding to user-
and developer-targeted documentation. In order to build the documentation, issue

    cd ROOT/build
    make doc        # for user's docs
    make devdoc     # for developer's docs

The documentation is then generated in this directory, in the `html` and
`dev-html` directories, respectively.
