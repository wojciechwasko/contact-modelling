Introduction
============

`contact-modelling` is a library developed as part of the requirements for my
Master thesis. It deals with processing tactile data -- output of capacitive
transduction-based artificial skin systems.

Source code layout
==================
The library is located in `contact-modelling` directory. Directory `cm-clients`
contains various toy consumers of the library I use along the way.

The directory named `3rd_party` contains informations and placeholder
directories for external libraries `contact-modelling` depends on. In each of
the dependencies' directory, there's a README file with instructions on how to
obtain the required libraries.

Building and testing
====================
The build toolchain is `CMake`. To build the library,

    cd build/ && cmake .. && make

Unit tests are written using [boost test](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/)
library. To build and execute tests,

    cd build/ && cmake .. && make check

Accessing documentation
=======================
Source code is documented using [doxygen](www.doxygen.org). To generate the
documentation,

    cd build/ && cmake .. && make doc

This generates a user's documentation (i.e. implementation details are hidden).
To build full documentation,

    cd build/ && cmake .. && make devdoc

Each of these commands generates an HTML version of the documentation in
`doc/html` and `doc/dev-html` respectively.
